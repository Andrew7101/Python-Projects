# Discord Casino Bot

## Overview
The **Discord Casino Bot** is a multi-feature Discord bot that allows users to engage in various casino-style games and simulations directly within their Discord servers. Users can manage their virtual tokens, play games like **Blackjack** and **Slot Machine**, or participate in a **Mock Stock Market**. The bot is built using Python's `discord.py` library and incorporates interactive elements like buttons and views for a fully immersive experience.

## Features
- **Blackjack**: A classic game where players compete against the dealer to get a score as close to 21 as possible without exceeding it. Includes options to **Hit**, **Stand**, **Double**, and **Replay**.
- **Slot Machine**: Spin the reels to win tokens. The bot displays a colorful, animated slot machine with various symbols. Players can earn tokens based on matching symbols.
- **Mock Stock Market**: Users can buy and sell stocks based on fluctuating prices. The bot dynamically updates stock prices and allows users to manage their virtual portfolios.
- **Account Management**: Users have virtual tokens to play with, and they can check their balance and reset their scores.
